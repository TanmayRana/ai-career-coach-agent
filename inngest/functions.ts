Generate a spacious, tree-structured learning roadmap for a React Flow diagram in JSON format.

Requirements:
- The layout should resemble the vertical structure of roadmap.sh.
- Each step should progress from fundamentals (top) to advanced topics (bottom).
- Include branches for specializations where applicable (e.g., testing, performance, deployment).
- Each node must contain:
  - A unique "id"
  - A fixed "type": "turbo"
  - "position": with meaningful and spaced-out x/y coordinates. Maintain vertical flow with y-incremented values (e.g., y += 250). Use different x-coordinates (e.g., -400, 0, 400) to separate branches.
  - "data" object with:
    - "title": A concise name for the step.
    - "description": A short two-line explanation of what the step covers.
    - "link": A relevant and high-quality learning resource (official docs, articles, or tutorials).
    - "color": A hex color code for the node's background color.
- Nodes should be well-spaced for clarity (suggested spacing: y += 250-300 between levels, x Â± 400 for branches).
- Also generate a list of unique "edges", where each edge includes:
  - "id"
  - "source" (source node ID)
  - "target" (target node ID)

Format the entire response as a single JSON object like:
{
  "roadmapTitle": "[Your Roadmap Title Here]",
  "description": "[3-5 lines summarizing the roadmap's scope, goals, and intended audience.]",
  "duration": "[Estimated completion time, e.g., '6-12 Months', 'Ongoing']",
  "initialNodes": [

  "initialEdges": [
    // edges go here
